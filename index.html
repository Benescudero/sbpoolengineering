            <div class="product-content">
                <h3>Why should you buy a Cell Shield?</h3>
                <p>Good question. The short answer is because installing a cell shield over your salt cell will save you money.</p>
                
                <h3>How will it save me money?</h3>
                <p>Now that's a great question! Let's face it—nothing is built to last anymore, whether it's your refrigerator, TV, or even your vehicle. The pool industry is no different. For example, the salt cell you purchased to sanitize your pool water is considered a "consumable product" by its manufacturer. I don't know about you, but I dislike spending over $1,000 every few years to replace my salt cell. Additionally, you're often required to buy your salt cell from the same company that designed it to last not too long after their manufacturer warranty expires. The Cell Shield is warrantied for life and helps you get more bang for your buck - making your salt cell aka "consumable product" consume itself at a slower rate - thus extending the useful life of your salt cell, ultimately saving you money in the long run.</p>
                
                <p>At Shield Bear 3-D P, we have created optimal conditions surrounding your salt cell by eliminating UV rays that will degrade its plastic shell and stress its electrical components, leading to cracks and potential salt cell failure. The cell shield helps safeguard your salt cells exposed components from the elements, ensuring it operates more effectively and lasts longer.</p>
                
                <p>This next part is particularly interesting!! Our extensive and ongoing field studies have shown that the cell shield reduces your salt cells core temperature by approximately 10 degrees annually when the pool is not running. What does that mean? Most pools are built in areas with hard to very hard water containing high levels of calcium that adhere to metals as the water temperature increases. The Cell Shield helps by lowering the internal temperature of your salt cell's core by about 10 degrees annually when the pool is not running. This decrease significantly reduces calcium buildup on the salt cells essential titanium-coated diodes ensuring better sanitation for your pool.</p>
                
                <p>The Cell Shield protects the exterior of your salt cell and simultaneously ensures that the internal components necessary for producing sanitizing chlorine for your pool water can function more effectively and last longer.</p>
